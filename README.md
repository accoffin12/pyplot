# Overview:
This notebook demonstrates the use of python to create visualizations of data. For the initial question I will demonstrate two different techniques to generate the graph. All other questions will be answered utilizing a DataFrame as it allows for greater data organization and manipulation. 

# Matplotlib and pyplot

Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository.
To be submitted for credit, all changes must be committed and pushed to this repository (do not create your own repository unless instructed to on the course website).

## Rubric

Each question is worth two points: 

* Data plotted as described by the question (1 pt)
* Plot contains required elements (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)
